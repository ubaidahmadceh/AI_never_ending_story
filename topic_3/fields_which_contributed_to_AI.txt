3 - Fields Which contributed to AI
AI is comparatively a newer field not older than 70 to 80 years. So it can definitely use some already done immense work from well established disciplines.
Here are Some of Fields which contributed in evolution of Artificial Intelligence:


- Philosphy => Gave idea of logic or rationality which governs the working on human mind.
                e.g. Aristotle is a Man and All men are mortal (So Aristotle is mortal)

- Mathematics => It layed out priciples to perform logic in numerical form.
                e.g. Booleans or first Order logic

- Economics => Study of what actions led to nation's wealth or How a nation can maximize it's profits
                e.g. A ML model trying to maximize it's accuracy

- Neuroscience => How brain store information (Knowledge representation), Perceive from environment and the perform certain actions.
                e.g. An AI agent trying to interact with environment in reinforcement learning

- Psycology => How our thought process lead to a reaction to an actions. What changes happens in human mind.
                e.g. How Neural networks change their internal parameters while learning or when trying to make prediction  

- Linguistic => How we use the context and Knowledge of matter while speaking.
                e.g. How chatbot can respond in a certain context (This gave birth to NLP)
